                        <br />
                        My name is Rohil Pawar and I am a 16 year old high school 
                        student, and passionate about learning and exploring new 
                        new things. I am also very passionate about music. I have 
                        been playing the piano since I was 8 years old, and I have 
                        been playing the cello since I was 12.  I have even 
                        performed at a few local venues. I am also very active in 
                        my schoolâ€™s extracurricular activities. I am a member of 
                        DECA, TSA, FBLA, and Data Science and I have won several 
                        awards for each of these clubs. I am also a prior member 
                        of a robotics team, and I have been a part of several 
                        successful projects. I am also very involved in my community. 
                        I volunteer at a local shelter, and at the First Tee of Greater 
                        Charlotte. I am passionate about making a difference in my 
                        community, and I am always looking for ways to help out.
